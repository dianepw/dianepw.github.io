        <img src="portrait.jpg">
        <p>As a psychotherapist, I work collaboratively with clients of all ages to clarify needs and bring lasting
            positive change. I have a passion for helping children and adolescents develop lifelong coping skills,
            supporting adults in overcoming challenges, and guiding families through significant life transitions.</p>
        <p>My particular areas of interest include ADHD, high-functioning autism, anxiety, depression, and trauma. I
            also offer specialized <a href="#family-resolution">resolution services</a> for families in conflict and
            crisis, including reunification therapy, co-parent coaching, and court-ordered Parenting Coordination.</p>
        <p>Building on a background in relational psychotherapy, I use cognitive-behavioral, play-based, mindfulness,
            and <a href="#somatic-experiencing">somatic techniques</a> to inform our work together.</p>
        <p>But, most importantly, I emphasize my clients’ personal strengths, encourage exploration, and build capacity
            to cope with challenges with compassion and humor.</p>
        <p>Currently, I work as a therapist in Durham, NC. I welcome individuals from surrounding communities for
            in-person visits and throughout North Carolina via secure telehealth.</p>

        <h3>Individual Therapy</h3>
        <p>I offer individual therapy for children (4 years and older), teenagers, and adults. I view therapy as a
            partnership (even with my youngest clients) and encourage ongoing feedback. My therapeutic approach is
            flexible and collaborative, drawing from different modalities based on client need. I have training in areas
            including play therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, sand tray therapy, mindfulness, and <a
                href="#somatic-experiencing">Somatic Experiencing</a>.</p>
        <h3>Family Therapy</h3>
        <p>I work together with family members to resolve specific areas of conflict or improve overall communication
            and cooperation. Most often my family therapy sessions include all the members of the family, but can also
            focus on a parent-child or sibling relationship.</p>
        <h3>Parent Coaching</h3>
        <p>My parent coaching services focus on empowering parents to create environments of mutual respect and
            communication, understand behavioral concerns, and improve emotional management for both self and child. I
            am a certified Triple P (Positive Parenting Program) provider.</p>
        <p>I also offer <a href="#family-resolution">co-parent coaching</a> to improve parent collaboration
            post-divorce.</p>
        <h3 id="family-resolution">Family Resolution</h3>
        <p>I offer the following Family Resolution services to navigate high-conflict divorce, ease communication, and
            repair relational issues.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Co-parent Coaching</b>
                <p>Your relationship may have ended, but your connection as co-parents continues. I offer co-parent
                    coaching for support and skill-building to minimize reactivity, improve communication, and assist in
                    decision-making so your children remain the focus.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Reunification Therapy</b>
                <p>I offer reunification therapy to address relationship disruptions between parent and child.
                    Typically, reunification therapy is recommended or ordered by the courts when a child is resisting
                    or refusing contact with a parent. Reunification therapy usually occurs in cases of high-conflict
                    divorce, but may also be recommended in cases where a parent and child have had contact issues
                    related to involvement with child protective services, military deployment, incarceration, or other
                    causes of separation.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Parenting Coordination</b>
                <p>As a Parenting Coordinator, I may be appointed by the Court to help parents follow the provisions of
                    their child custody order, reduce conflict, and negotiate decisions regarding their children.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="heading" id="somatic-experiencing">About Somatic Experiencing</div>
        <hr>
        <p>I have completed extensive training in Somatic Experiencing (SE), a body-oriented method for resolving trauma
            symptoms and relieving chronic stress. SE uses the nervous system’s own resources to gently restore
            stability, improve emotional regulation, and decrease overall distress. I enjoy educating both children and
            adults about the role of the nervous system in emotional and behavioral responses, and I incorporate
            embodied techniques into therapy when appropriate and desired.</p>
