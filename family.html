        <p>Your relationship may have ended, but your connection as co-parents continues.</p>
        <p>CommonGround Co-Parenting™ is a coaching approach that begins by focusing on what unites you: your shared
            love for your child and your mutual hopes for their well-being.</p>
        <p>Even in the midst of conflict, we start with shared goals—like stability, safety, and healthy development—and
            use them as a foundation. From there, we build practical strategies to navigate communication, boundaries,
            and decision-making.</p>
        <p>The process is structured and supportive, helping you shift from old patterns toward a more effective
            co-parenting partnership that truly serves your child.</p>
        <h4>Intensive Family Therapy</h4>
        <p>Past conflict, changes in the family, or misunderstandings can create distance between you and your child—at times even leading them to resist or refuse contact.</p>
        <p>Intensive family therapy, including reunification support when needed, provides a safe space to begin rebuilding trust, improving communication, and creating an environment of mutual respect. Our goal: a stronger foundation for growth and connection so you and your child can find your way back to each other.</p>
        <h4>Parenting Coordination</h4>
        <p>Parenting Coordination offers co-parents an alternative dispute resolution process to traditional court involvement. As a Parenting Coordinator (PC), I provide parents with education about children’s needs, strategies to manage conflict, and assistance in implementing, modifying, and complying with their parenting plan.</p>
